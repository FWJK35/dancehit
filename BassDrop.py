    Loads an audio file, computes its RMS energy, and then divides the song into non-overlapping
    windows of length window_duration (in seconds). For each window, if its average RMS is greater 
    than threshold_multiplier times the overall RMS average, the start time of that window is marked as a peak.
    
    Parameters:
        audio_file (str): Path to the audio file.
        hop_length (int): Number of samples between successive RMS frames.
        window_duration (float): Duration (in seconds) of each window.
        threshold_multiplier (float): Multiplier for the overall RMS average to define the threshold.
    
    Returns:
        overall_avg (float): Overall average RMS of the song.
        threshold (float): The computed threshold (threshold_multiplier Ã— overall_avg).
        times (np.array): Time stamps for each RMS frame.
        rms (np.array): RMS energy per frame.
        peak_times (list): List of times (in seconds) marking the start of each window that qualifies as a peak.
